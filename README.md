# UI Test Automation Framework

## Description
This is an UI testing framework created for personal assessment. Therefore, it is meant for evaluation purposes only and I do not authorize it to be used in a different way. 

## Preconditions
In order to run the testing framework, you must have the following tools installed in your local environment. Click on each of them to see how to do so:
- [Java 19](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-java-development-kit-jdk-on-windows-mac-and-linux/?ref=rp)
- [Maven 3.9.0.](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac)
- [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html)
- [Git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Architecture
This UI testing framework has been based on a simple and straightforward structure where you will find two layers only, the logic layer using the Page Factory pattern where web elements are defined and functions applying actions over them, and the testing layer where the tests call the functions mentioned above and perform assertions to ensure the expected behavior in the UI. These layers are the ones provided by Java by default.

In summary, Maven is the packages and dependencies manager which provides us with the libraries and packages needed. TestNG is the test runner that runs the different tests and generates the reports, Selenium Web Driver is the interface that allows us to interact with the browser, and Java is the main programming language.

I decided to use this architecture and tools because of its simplicity, scalability, ease of use, and performance.
As you might notice, it is pretty simple and fast to automate the tests and get onboard on it  You do not need a lot of time to understand it on get used to it due to its simplicity, and they give us all we need to do a good verification process.

## Guide to use it

Once you have all the preconditions installed in your local environment, follow these instructions using your terminal or command-line:


- Clone the repo https://github.com/Massielg23/ui-testing-framework which contains the testing framework we are going to use:

    `git clone https://github.com/Massielg23/ui-testing-framework.git`


- Go to the repo root folder and execute the automated tests:

    `cd ./ui-testing-framework/`

    `mvn clean test`


- Open the report by clicking on the `index.html` file located in: ui-testing-framework/target/surefire-reports/index.html

## Explanation of the Solution

### src/main/java/pageObjects/
This is the logic layer. In this layer you will find classes that contain the web elements and functions applying actions on the web elements. The classes are based on the pages of the web app.

### src/test/java/
This is the testing layer. In this layer you will find the test classes where tests call the functions from the logic layer and perform verifications (assertions) against the web elements.

### target/surefire-reports
This is the reporting layer. We are using the reports generated by TestNG by default.
